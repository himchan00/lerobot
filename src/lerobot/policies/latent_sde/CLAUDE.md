# LatentSDE policy — implementation reference

Latent-SDE policy for hierarchical manipulation (`research_brief.md` is the design source).
Built as a **like-for-like swap of DiffusionPolicy's denoising U-Net**: the ResNet path uses the
same vision backbone (`DiffusionRgbEncoder`) and FiLM-with-scale conditioning, with the same
`GroupNorm` / `down_dims` ladder. The FiLM drift replaces chunk-horizon Conv1d with **point-wise
Linear** layers and is the light, per-tick part of the policy: it reads only the current state (plus
the wrist F/T with `use_ft`) and `z` (its only FiLM conditioning). Observation context reaches it
only through the prior's `z`. With
SmolVLM2 the prior reads the VLM token K/V the way SmolVLA's action expert does.

## Core idea

The geometry fixes the action representation:

- `sde_geometry="euclidean"` (Push-T target-state actions): `a ≈ x + s·(μ(x, z) + σ·ε)`
- `sde_geometry="so3_r3_body"` (LIBERO relative commands): body increment `≈ s·(μ + σ·ε)`, see below

One drift step per action at the environment's own rate (no model-time Δt). `s` is the per-dimension
action scale (`action_scale.py`): the std of the one-step target over the dataset, so μ is a
standardized one-step action and σ, `state_noise_std` are fractions of a typical action.
Training is a **β-VAE** regularized by `KL[q‖p]` on a per-chunk latent strategy `z`. The
teacher-forced target is `(a−x)/s` in Euclidean mode.
`deterministic_inference=True` removes the `σ·ε` term.
The opt-in `so3_r3_body` path uses body-local action targets and the same Gaussian/MSE
and EMA machinery. Pose integration is a product retraction; the likelihood is a local
tangent approximation, not a globally normalized manifold transition.

## The three quantities (clocks differ)

| sym | meaning                                                                                                                                                  | clock                                                                 | fed to net as                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----|---------|-------|---------------|
| `x` | measured robot state (proprio). PushT: 2-D `observation.state`; LIBERO: 8-D.                                                                             | every tick (fast)                                                     | the drift's input: the **CURRENT single frame** `(B, state_dim)` — the drift is velocity-blind; scene/motion context lives in `z`. The `target_state` residual is anchored to this frame.                                 |
| context | joint causal observation context: image history plus state history for ResNet (vector `h`), or image/task tokens plus one projected token per causal state frame for SmolVLM2 (layer-wise K/V). | refreshed every `n_action_steps` ticks (matches DP vision duty cycle) | the prior only: MLP on `h` (ResNet) or the token-KV expert (SmolVLM2)                                                                                                                                                    |
| `z` | per-chunk latent strategy (CVAE). | re-sampled every `n_action_steps` ticks with each context refresh | the drift's only FiLM conditioning |

`observation.environment_state` is deliberately ignored; `observation.state` is always part of the
joint causal context.

## Files

- `configuration_latent_sde.py` — `LatentSDEConfig` (draccus `@register_subclass("latent_sde")`). All knobs, derived defaults, and the `*_delta_indices` properties that shape the dataloader windows.
- `modeling_latent_sde.py` — everything else (see map below).
- `processor_latent_sde.py` — pre/post pipelines. The ResNet path remains identical to DP's; the SmolVLM2 path additionally applies the existing task-newline/tokenizer steps and keeps visual normalization as identity.
- `modeling_smolvlm_context.py` — frozen generic SmolVLM2 context encoder with trainable state tokens; returns the layer-wise prefix K/V. It does not construct the SmolVLA action expert.
- `modeling_context.py` — joint observation context: ResNet `h`, or SmolVLM2 per-layer K/V and valid-token mask.
- `modeling_token_kv.py` — the token-KV prior: a SmolVLA-style action expert whose one learnable query reads the layer-wise K/V.
- `geometry.py` — compact Torch-only body local/retract, continuous state features, controller
  adapters, and nearest-pose distance.
- `action_scale.py` — sweeps the dataset once before training for the per-dimension action scale `s`
  (std of the clean one-step target; the target keeps its mean; body mode: one value per position/rotation
  3-vector + gripper). Cached as JSON under `$HF_LEROBOT_HOME/latent_sde_action_scale/<repo_id>/`,
  reused when present, and written into `config.action_scale` so checkpoints carry it. Called from
  `LatentSDEPolicy.__init__` only when training from scratch (`dataset_meta` given, no pretrained path).
- `__init__.py` — exports `LatentSDEConfig`, `LatentSDEPolicy`, `make_latent_sde_pre_post_processors`.

### `modeling_latent_sde.py` map

- `LatentSDEPolicy` — LeRobot policy interface (`reset` / `select_action` / `predict_action_chunk` / `forward`) + DP-style obs queues + the h/z inference cache. Thin wrapper.
- `LatentSDEModel` — assembles `h`, holds prior/posterior/vq + drift net, exposes `compute_loss` (train) and `step` (inference). Mirrors `DiffusionModel`.
- `LatentSDEDriftDiffusionNet` / `FiLMResidualMLPBlock` — point-wise FiLM-ResNet hourglass, port of `DiffusionConditionalUnet1d`. Each block's FiLM (scale, bias) is a plain `Linear(z)`: DP's leading `Mish` would alias `z < −1.19`, where Mish is not injective. Outputs drift `μ` only; the variance (scalar; per position/rotation/gripper group in body mode) is EMA-calibrated, not a net output.
- Latent-z modules: `LatentPrior` (Gaussian p(z|h)), `SmolVLMTokenKVPrior` (Gaussian p(z|VLM tokens)), `LatentPriorVQ` (VQ p(k|h)), `LatentPosteriorTraj` (Gaussian), `LatentPosteriorTrajVQ` (deterministic + VQ).
- `_TrajEncoder` — **TCN** (dilated Temporal Conv Net, Bai et al. 2018) over a variable-length trajectory: 1×1 channel lift + kernel-3 dilated residual blocks (`_TCNResidualBlock`, dilation 1,2,4,… doubling per level) + masked mean-pool. `RF = 1 + 4·(2^L − 1)` grows exponentially with depth. Depth: **auto-sized** `num_levels = max(1, round(log2(horizon/4)))` so RF ≈ `horizon` (e.g. horizon 8→1, 16→2, 32→3, 64→4), set in `LatentSDEModel.__init__`. `_MaskedGroupNorm` / `_masked_mean_pool` support it (pads zeroed before every dilated conv → eval outputs bit-equivalent to exact-length, no cross-pad leak).

## Latent z subsystem

**Prior `p(z|context)`** (inference + KL target) — the only module that reads observations; the
drift sees them only through `z`. `context_encoder` fixes it. ResNet: MLP `LatentPrior` (Gaussian)
on `ObservationContext.h`, the image-window embedding concatenated with an embedding of the absolute
`n_obs_steps` state window; VQ swaps in `LatentPriorVQ`. SmolVLM2: `SmolVLMTokenKVPrior` (Gaussian
only) — one learnable query runs through a SmolVLA-style action expert over the layer-wise K/V of
the image-task prefix plus one projected token per causal state frame (oldest to newest), and heads
give `(μ_p, σ_p)`.

**Posterior `q(z | a_{0:H})`** (training only). It always encodes only the time-aligned
demonstration action trajectory (each tick with that tick's W̄_k under `use_ft`; impedance targets: the clean
one-step targets, see below); observation context and state trajectories are not posterior inputs. A 2-layer MLP trunk produces the Gaussian heads, and the VQ posterior mirrors the same
action-only trajectory contract.

**Sampling.** Gaussian: reparam `z = μ_q + σ_q·ε`. Discrete (`use_vq=True`, flavor set by
`config.quantizer`): deterministic `z_e` → quantizer → `z_q`, with a flat categorical prior over
`num_codes` trained by CE on the detached flat code index.

- `"fsq"` (Mentzer 2309.15505): bounded scalar grid + straight-through rounding — no learnable
  codebook / EMA / commitment loss; `z_dim = len(fsq_levels)`, `num_codes = prod(fsq_levels)`.
- `"vq"` (van den Oord 1711.00937): learnable codebook + EMA (`vq_decay`) + commitment loss
  (`vq_commit_weight`); `z_dim` stays `z_dim`, `num_codes = vq_codebook_size`. Keep the codebook
  ≤ batch_size so `kmeans_init` seeds every code.

The VQ/FSQ prior receives attached context. Prior cross-entropy therefore trains shared trainable
context projections, while frozen backbone parameters remain frozen.

**Inference uses the prior only** (no future actions available) — `sample_z_from_prior`.
`z` is re-sampled with each `h` refresh (every `n_action_steps` ticks).

## Loss (`LatentSDEModel.compute_loss`)

`compute_loss` shares h-encoding, the padding mask, and the z posterior/prior, then branches on
`use_vq`. The following formulas describe the default Euclidean path:

```
non-VQ:  loss = (nll + beta·KL[q‖p])·sg(2σ̄²)  # Gaussian ELBO, rescaled
         # σ̄² = mean σ² over coordinates. ∂nll/∂μ = 1/(2σ²)·∂mse/∂μ, so the recon gradient = the MSE gradient
         # weighted by σ̄²/σ² (plain MSE in Euclidean mode, one σ²); β ratio unchanged.
         # Logged nll_loss / kl_loss are unscaled.
         nll  = mean_{H·D} [0.5·log(2πσ²) + (d*−μ)²/(2σ²)]
         d*   = (a−x)/s                      # standardized one-step target, std ≈ 1 (body mode: see below)
         KL   also divided by H·D            # shared 1/(H·D) scale → β keeps its meaning (β=1 = ELBO)
         σ² = action_var (buffer)           # NOT gradient-trained: EMA of the analytic MLE mean‖d*−μ‖² (σ-VAE);
                                            # body mode: one per position/rotation/gripper group
VQ/FSQ:  loss = mean‖μ − d*‖² + other_loss  # MSE-mean recon (σ untrained here)
         other_loss = fsq_prior_weight·prior-CE            ("fsq"; no commit loss)
                    = vq_commit_weight·commit + vq_prior_weight·prior-CE   ("vq")
```

- **Calibrated σ + β.** The Gaussian decoder variance is the non-gradient `action_var` buffer,
  warm-started and EMA-calibrated toward the analytic batch MLE. `beta` is the β-VAE KL coefficient.
  Inference SDE noise per step is `s·σ·ε`; `deterministic_inference=True` (default) skips it.
  `target_rms` logs the RMS of `d*` (≈1, slightly more with state noise).
- A plain-MSE `recon_loss` is logged in every path for the z-usage / prior-leakage diagnostics
  (`z_usage_gap`, `prior_recon_gap`), which compare recon MSE across z choices.
- **Padding & masking.** `drop_n_last_frames` (default 0 with the padding mask, else `max(0, horizon − n_action_steps − n_obs_steps + 1)`) keeps the EXECUTED region unpadded, but the predicted tail may be copy-padded at episode ends. With `do_mask_loss_for_padding=True`, `compute_loss` builds `valid = ~action_is_pad` `(B, H)` and (a) zeroes padded ticks in the recon MSE (`recon_se * valid.unsqueeze(-1)`, still normalized by nominal `B·H·D`, DP-style) and (b) passes `valid` as the per-chunk posterior `valid_mask`. With `do_mask_loss_for_padding=False` (default) `valid` is all-True — recon is a plain `.mean()` over `(B, H, D)` and the posterior mask is all-True, identical to the legacy behavior.
  The posterior keeps **time-aligned actions** and does not read state or observation context.
  With `normalize_state=True`, its Euclidean target-state trajectory is re-centered on the clean
  chunk-initial state. Pose mode feeds the posterior the clean body-frame increment
  `[local(x_k, E_k), a_grip]/s` (the noise-free drift target), not the raw world-frame command.

- **Train-only augmentation.** In Euclidean mode, `state_noise_std>0` perturbs the
  measured-state window by `std·s` per frame (i.i.d. per tick; `std` is a fraction of a typical
  one-step action; preset pusht 0.3, libero 0) and recomputes the corrective target toward the time-aligned (or
  nearest) action. Pose mode uses the geometry-aware augmentation below.

## Opt-in body-frame product geometry

`sde_geometry="so3_r3_body"` supports LIBERO relative OSC_POSE commands. Require
`STATE=IDENTITY`, `ACTION=IDENTITY` statistical normalization. Visual preprocessing is unchanged.
The caller is responsible for matching the environment and observation layout.

Keep raw state8/action7, the existing temporal windows (impedance targets extend the state and F/T windows by one
tick), and the clean action-only posterior (fed body-frame increments / s, see Padding & masking).
Geometry uses flat poses `[p(3), q_xyzw(4)]` and six-dimensional normalized body increments,
but state features remain 11-dimensional: `[p, R[:,0], R[:,1], finger_qpos]`, with no feature scaling.
Joint observation context always uses absolute pose features. With the default
`normalize_state=True`, only the drift query uses the clean chunk-start pose `(p0, R0)` as its frame:

```text
p_relative = R0.T @ (p - p0)
R_relative = R0.T @ R
drift_features = [p_relative, R_relative[:,0], R_relative[:,1], finger_qpos]
```

Finger positions stay absolute. Do not subtract axis-angle vectors or rotation-column features.
The reference is the current state at context refresh, not the oldest observation in the context
window; it is held for `n_action_steps` ticks and cleared on reset. Training uses that same clean
origin even when drift queries are augmented. `normalize_state=False` keeps absolute drift features.
This is a drift-input coordinate change, not full-policy frame invariance: context still contains
absolute proprioception and camera information.

Body mode works in the grip-site (TCP) frame G, the controller's and the F/T's. robosuite's `eef_quat` is the hand
body's rotation instead (its Panda grippers, FT-4's and LIBERO's, are mounted turned −90° about the hand's z:
`R_site = R_hand @ Rz(−90°)`; the position is the grip site's already). The policy converts state8 once
(`hand_to_grip_site` in `forward` / `select_action`), so the prior's absolute pose features, the drift's
chunk-start-relative (G_0) features and the drift's body outputs (G_t) all use G. World controller
commands and the action scale (one value per 3-vector) do not change. Checkpoints trained before 2026-10-14 (hand
frame) need the code before this change.

**Tier-3 impedance targets (`impedance_targets=True`, FT-4 with `--env.impedance=true`).** Instead of the OSC
command, the drift models the one-step likelihood p(s_{k+1} | s_k, z) of s = (pose relative to x_0, W̄, gripper),
whose product over the chunk is the chunk's likelihood: 14 outputs, Gaussian `local(x_t, x_{t+1})`, a hurdle W̄_{t+1}
(Bernoulli contact = W̄_{t+1} ≠ 0 × Gaussian W̄ where in contact) and a Bernoulli gripper, one action scale and σ² per
Gaussian 3-vector (`IMPEDANCE_GROUPS`), the logits' NLL their BCE. W̄_i is the tick mean of frame i's F/T samples in
G_i (each sample in its physics step's frame, `geometry.tick_mean_wrench`); W̄_{t+1} is rotated into G_t. The labels
(`geometry.impedance_one_step`) come from state and F/T windows one tick past the horizon. The data has no state after
an episode's last action: that frame is extrapolated at constant body velocity from the last two (`_extend_past_end`;
0.15 mm median error on FT-4) with the F/T held; a window that starts at an episode's last frame cannot extrapolate and
its x̂_{t+1} leaves the loss (a per-element loss mask). The drift reads W̄_k (`use_ft`, over the W̄
target's scale), the quantity it predicts, so at deployment `step()` takes the model's own second step from
(x̂_{t+1}, W̄_{t+1}) (`geometry.impedance_next_state`) and composes the controller's 25 targets x̂_{t+1}, x̂_{t+2},
W̄_{t+1}, W̄_{t+2}, gripper (`geometry.impedance_action`: metres, radians, N, N·m, gripper).
The second step's input W̄_{t+1} is gated (1[π > 0.5]·μ_W, 0 off contact like the measured W̄); the controller's
W̄_{t+1}, W̄_{t+2} are μ_W, zeroed while the measured |W̄_t| force is below `wrench_gate` (default 1 N), so F_d ramps
to 0 off contact (2026-10-20 evals: gating by the measured force beat the policy's contact probability; 5 N starved
the Door turn). The posterior reads the clean one-step targets [x̂_{k+1}, W̄_{k+1}]/s and the gripper command, without
the F/T feature (they hold it), and skips ticks whose x̂_{k+1} is unknown. The controller (`envs/ft4_impedance.py`)
starts each tick's reference at the measured state and F_d at the measured W̄_t, applies the targets at the measured
pose and uses the full Λ (deploy ablation 2026-10-23, reactive z16, /240: this 81 vs a reference continued from the
previous tick 50). State noise (train only, `action_anchor="clean"`) relabels x̂_{t+1} from x̃_k = x_k ⊕ ε_k toward
x_{k+1} ⊕ (1−β)ε_k, β = `state_noise_gain` the share of ε returned per tick; the F/T input, the W̄ label and the
posterior stay clean. Wrench noise (train only, `wrench_noise_std` σ, `wrench_noise_gain` β) is its force analogue:
the drift reads W̃_k = W̄_k + ε_k, ε_k ~ N(0, (σ‖·‖)²) per force / torque 3-vector (none in free space), and the
W̄_{t+1} label moves by (1−β)ε_k (ticks leaving contact stay out of the hurdle's Gaussian). Needs `use_ft` and the
padding mask. Options dropped on 2026-10-27 (proportional σ², prior / drift history, a state-trajectory
posterior, mean / gated controller W̄, the controller's κ anchor, continued reference and decoupled Λ) and checkpoints with
the earlier 25 two-step outputs (before 2026-10-16) need the code saved with their run (`outputs/queue_tier3/<run>.code.patch`).

Fixed LIBERO unit conversion (0.05 m / 0.5 rad per command) stays private to `geometry.py`;
it is not a tunable metric or diffusion setting.

```text
local(x,y):   u = [R_x.T @ (p_y-p_x) / 0.05, Log(R_x.T @ R_y) / 0.5]
retract(x,u): p_out = p_x + R_x @ (0.05*u[:3])
              R_out = R_x @ Exp(0.5*u[3:])
```

Training uses normalized body-controller increments: the model converts a clean relative controller
action into a nominal endpoint, recomputes `local(query, target)`, concatenates the independent
gripper command, and divides by the action scale `s` (one value per position/rotation 3-vector plus
the gripper, so it commutes with the body rotation). Body mode keeps one `action_var` σ² per
position/rotation/gripper group, each the residual of its group. Sampling uses one ordinary Gaussian draw in those
same seven output coordinates (six body, one gripper) and clips only the final controller command.
These output coordinates remain local to the current measured pose, not the chunk-start frame;
controller conversion still uses the absolute current pose.

`action_anchor="nearest"` uses only the squared local pose increment norm for selection. State noise
uses the existing schedule and one six-dimensional Gaussian in those same units. Padding is excluded
from nearest selection regardless of loss masking. The likelihood remains a **local tangent
approximation**, not a globally normalized manifold density.

## Opt-in wrist F/T (`use_ft`)

`observation.ft_wrench` `(25, 6)` per frame is the environment-interaction wrench at the wrist over the
control step that ended at that frame. It is the sum of MuJoCo contact forces on the bodies below the
PandaGripper F/T site, which is what a gravity- and inertia-compensated wrist sensor reads. It is taken
about the EE point and rotated into the EE frame at each 2 ms physics step, `[F, τ]` in N and N·m, and is
exactly 0 in free space.

Datasets come from `examples/port_datasets/libero_hf` (raw LIBERO demos replayed with 500 Hz logging;
frame 0 holds the last settle step). The LIBERO env produces the same with `--env.ft_wrench=true`
(`envs/libero_ft.py`).

Do not feed the raw sensor reading. With the static weight removed, it still carries the gripper's
inertial reaction to the OSC acceleration, so in free space it predicts the previous command
(held-out R² 0.94). A drift fed that reading copied its own last action and reached 5% vs 70%.

F/T (`use_ft`, body mode) is read as the tick-mean wrench, the quantity the impedance drift predicts, so OSC and
impedance policies see the same input: `LatentSDEModel.ft_features` turns each frame's block into W̄_k, the mean of
its 25 samples, each rotated from its physics step's frame (the body slerp from the previous frame) into the frame's
grip-site frame G_k (`geometry.tick_mean_wrench`), over `ft_scale`: the data std of the impedance one-step W̄_{t+1}
target (its `action_scale[6:12]`), taken from the same cached sweep for OSC too. The earlier `ft_preprocess` features
(`"asinh"`, and `"forge"`: FORGE's EMA + noise + tanh over a p90 scale; LIBERO and FT-4 OSC runs) were removed on
2026-10-27; their checkpoints need the code before that.

The drift appends W̄_k to its state features, and the OSC posterior to each action (the impedance posterior's
one-step targets hold W̄ already). The prior is unchanged. Wrench noise perturbs the drift's W̄_k in both modes.
`ft_usage_gap` is the recon error with batch-rolled F/T
minus the recon error, so ~0 means the drift ignores F/T. Read it next to `z_usage_gap`, because F/T can
explain actions that `z` would otherwise carry.

- `hf.*` and `osc.*` dataset keys never reach the policy, because the preprocessor's `batch_to_transition`
  keeps only `observation.*`, action and `*_is_pad` keys. A policy input must be an `observation.*` key.
- Train on the policy view without those columns (`regenerate_libero_hf.py slim`, `himchan00/libero_hf_policy`).
  lerobot gathers whole rows for every multi-frame window, so the wide `hf.*` rows make data loading
  ~10x slower (162 vs 13 ms per sample).
- The F/T logger refreshes derived quantities after every physics step. That leaves the rollout
  unchanged, but observables then sample the state after substep 24 of 25 instead of 23. The regenerated
  data has this timing, so evaluate any policy trained on it with `--env.ft_wrench=true`, even without
  F/T input.

## Invariants & gotchas

- Euclidean mode requires `action_dim == state_dim` (target-state actions) and uses `(action−state)/s`,
  preserving the Push-T action semantics. Relative-command environments (LIBERO) use `so3_r3_body`.
  `normalize_state=True` subtracts the clean chunk-initial state from Euclidean drift inputs and
  posterior actions.
- **`h` requires ≥1 image feature** — environment state does not replace visual context.
- **Dataloader windows** come from the config properties: state always gets
  `[1-n_obs_steps, horizon)`; images get `[1-n_obs_steps, 1)`; actions get `[0, horizon)`; F/T (`use_ft`) gets `[0, horizon)`.
  With `impedance_targets` the state and F/T windows end at `horizon + 1`; a window that starts at an episode's last
  frame has no earlier frame to extrapolate from, so that tick's x̂ target is masked and the posterior skips it.
  The leading `n_obs_steps` states form the causal context, while the trailing `H` states form the
  teacher-forced drift trajectory, overlapping at the current frame. `H = horizon`;
  `n_action_steps ≤ horizon` is the deploy execute/refresh period.
- `drop_n_last_frames` (default 0 with `do_mask_loss_for_padding=True`, else `max(0, horizon − n_action_steps − n_obs_steps + 1)`) drops the last anchors of each episode so the EXECUTED region stays within the episode; the predicted tail may be copy-padded and is masked iff `do_mask_loss_for_padding=True` (else included unmasked, DP-style default).
- `deterministic_inference=True` (default) gives drift-only inference; otherwise
  `action_var` supplies noise. `deterministic_z_inference` uses `μ_p` instead of sampling
  `z` (debug/ablation).

## Trainer hooks

No custom trainer hooks: the policy trains through the stock `lerobot_train.py` loop unchanged.

Factory wiring: `policies/factory.py` (`get_policy_class` / `make_policy_config` / processor factory, all gated on `name == "latent_sde"`).

## Config cheat-sheet (`LatentSDEConfig`)

**Env presets.** Env-dependent fields default to `None`; `__post_init__` fills them from
`ENV_PRESETS[--env.type]`, reading the training CLI with `parser.parse_arg` (saved configs are already
complete, so loading never needs it); explicit values win. `pusht` = DP recipe (resnet/euclidean,
2/16/8, crop 84, DP normalization, state noise 0.3, Adam + diffusers cosine); `libero` = SmolVLA recipe
(smolvlm2/so3_r3_body, 1/50/10, IDENTITY normalization, padding mask, no state noise, Adam +
cosine_decay_with_warmup over 30k; train with `--steps=30000`). Without `--env.type` these fields must be
given explicitly. The LIBERO setup and its justification are in `README_for_HC.md`.

Policy-specific compatibility and input preflight checks are omitted. `__post_init__` derives
`drop_n_last_frames`, FSQ `z_dim`, and ResNet `crop_shape`; `validate_features()` is a no-op required
by the base config interface. The settings and tensor layouts below are caller preconditions, not
automatically enforced compatibility guarantees. Stable rotation operations and valid nearest
candidates remain algorithm requirements. Space selection rejects obsolete or unknown geometry modes.

## SmolVLM2 / LIBERO usage

The backbone is the pure generic SmolVLM2 checkpoint, not `lerobot/smolvla_base`. Images must be
square; the default model requires `vlm_resize_shape=(512, 512)`. Neither the backbone nor the tokenizer is
revision-pinned: both load Hub `main`, like SmolVLA (a local snapshot path pins both). Saved policies still need the generic model and tokenizer available locally or
through the Hub when constructing the encoder.

The adapter matches SmolVLA's inference-prefill mathematics: BF16 loading, embedding scaling,
RoPE theta 10000, eager attention, and B-sized vision calls per frame/camera. Its prefix includes
`n_obs_steps` projected state tokens, ordered oldest to newest. Image/task queries cannot attend to
state tokens; each state query can attend to the image/task prefix, itself, and earlier state tokens.
Only the leading causal state window is encoded, never the future teacher-forced states.
The encoder returns only the per-layer token K/V, which the token-KV prior reads; the last VLM
layer's output is not computed. The `n_obs_steps=1` layout and parameter shapes are unchanged; multi-frame
checkpoints from the earlier current-state-only adapter are not behavior-equivalent.
See the measured parity boundary, simple default-setting commands, and paper settings in
`smolvlm2_head_baselines.md`.

Both context encoders take cameras in `input_features` visual-feature insertion order, like
SmolVLA. There is no separate camera-order option.

The four former posterior/prior conditioning options are removed rather than deprecated. Configs
containing `posterior_uses_h`, `posterior_uses_state`, `prior_uses_state`, or `posterior_state` fail
schema parsing. Existing weights are not guaranteed compatible with the new joint-context modules.

Explicit BF16 training uses `ACCELERATE_MIXED_PRECISION=bf16`; `policy.use_amp` alone does not
configure this trainer's Accelerator. Standalone evaluation also needs its CUDA autocast default
set to BF16 when matching that precision choice. Delta integration preserves the measured-state dtype so
BF16 drift outputs still produce float32 controller actions usable by NumPy.

The token-KV expert inherits the loaded text config's BF16 dtype, while its learnable query, output
head, and residual stream remain FP32. Cast activations to the consuming projection or MLP's weight
dtype at each boundary. Training and inference must work without autocast; do not force AMP or
upcast the whole expert to work around a dtype mismatch.

### Local integration smoke

Install the existing extras; `diffusion` supplies the current Latent-SDE scheduler:

```bash
conda run -n lerobot env CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 \
  uv sync --locked --extra latent_sde --extra training --extra diffusion --extra dataset --extra libero
```

On a fresh LIBERO installation, initialize its paths and download its assets with networking enabled.
Answer `N` to the first-import custom-dataset-path prompt to accept the defaults:

```bash
conda run --no-capture-output -n lerobot uv run python -c \
  'from libero.libero.utils.download_utils import download_assets_from_huggingface; download_assets_from_huggingface()'
```

The following reproduces the integration recipe: one update on pinned dataset episode 0, followed by
two simulator steps. Use fresh output directories. This is not an overfitting experiment or a benchmark
score; the evaluation task is intentionally only an independent simulator-I/O check.

```bash
conda run -n lerobot uv run lerobot-train \
  --policy.type=latent_sde \
  --env.type=libero \
  --policy.n_obs_steps=1 --policy.horizon=4 --policy.n_action_steps=2 \
  --policy.device=cuda --policy.push_to_hub=false \
  --dataset.repo_id=HuggingFaceVLA/libero \
  --dataset.revision=86958911c0f959db2bbbdb107eb3e17c5f9c798e \
  --dataset.episodes='[0]' \
  --output_dir=outputs/train/latent_sde_libero_smoke \
  --steps=1 --batch_size=1 --num_workers=0 --persistent_workers=false \
  --save_freq=1 --log_freq=1 --env_eval_freq=0 --wandb.enable=false

conda run -n lerobot env MUJOCO_GL=egl uv run lerobot-eval \
  --policy.path=outputs/train/latent_sde_libero_smoke/checkpoints/000001/pretrained_model \
  --policy.device=cuda \
  --env.type=libero --env.task=libero_spatial --env.task_ids='[0]' \
  --env.observation_height=256 --env.observation_width=256 --env.episode_length=2 \
  --eval.batch_size=1 --eval.n_episodes=1 --eval.use_async_envs=false \
  --output_dir=outputs/eval/latent_sde_libero_smoke
```

`--env.type=libero` applies the LIBERO preset (SmolVLM2 token-KV prior, `so3_r3_body`, IDENTITY
normalization); the horizon overrides only shrink the smoke.

The dataset metadata reports 10 FPS, while the installed LIBERO controller defaults to
`control_freq=20`; the environment factory does not override it, and `--env.fps` does not change that
simulator control frequency. The policy takes one step per environment step. Treat the
current delta output as a normalized controller command, not a verified physical state displacement.
